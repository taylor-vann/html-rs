# html-rs

Create HTML from component functions in Rust!


## Why

XML is historically aligned with document structures.

But there a lot of kinds of documents. And XML has elements like `<!-- comments -->` and `<![CDATA[some stuff]]>` that don't describe semantic structures.

So I wrote a library called [parsely](sdfsdf) for this reason. It's a parser for a subset of XML focused on _structure_ rather than data.


## Txml

`Tmxl-rs` builds off of parsley and provides a library agnostic way of building UIs in rust.
